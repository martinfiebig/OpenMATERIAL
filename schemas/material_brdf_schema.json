(1) Positivity: The BRDF has units of inverse steradians (1/sr) and can vary from 0 to infinity. (2) Helmholtz reciprocity: It is symmetric in the incoming and outgoing direction. (3) Energy conservation: No more radiant energy is reflected from a point on the surface than incident radiant energy to that point. ",
