= Use cases

////
Use cases in the context of ASAM standards describe the external behavior of the standardized system, that is, the interaction of the system with a user or another system.
The description of use cases is particularly useful for explaining the motivation for:

* New standards
* Development projects for a new major version of a standard
* Development projects for adding features to a minor version of a standard

Use cases are divided in three groups that view the standard from different perspectives.
A project proposal should consider all three perspectives in order to provide a comprehensive overview.

* *Business use cases* describe an economic advantage, a corporate requirement, a process, a method, or an element in a larger tool chain, which involves many people within one company or across multiple companies that have a customer-supplier relationship.

* *End user use cases* describe a requirement, process, method, or element of a tool chain that are handled by users who work with the standard.

* *Technical use cases* describe technical requirements for the operation and interoperability of technical systems, such as tools, test systems, or application software, which the standard supports.

This chapter provides a comprehensive list of use cases.
These use cases are structured to demonstrate how various aspects of {THIS_STANDARD} are applied.
They include the impact of technologies like 3D modeling tools and 3D engines, as well as specific _3D model_ formats such as glTF and FBX. 
This clear organization helps users understand the practical applications of {THIS_STANDARD} and how it integrates into their workflows.

[#tab-use-case-8, cols="1,5"]
.Use case 8: Moving _object parts_ in the environment simulation
|===
|*Description*                      |As a _simulation platform_ or sensor model developer, I want to move _objects_ as well as individual parts of the _objects_ during simulation runtime. These can be parts of a vehicle, for example, wheels and doors or the skeleton bones of a pedestrian. One option to manipulate the imported _3D assets_ during simulation runtime is using ASAM OSI. In the https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/V3.6.0/gen/structosi3_1_1GroundTruth.html[osi3::GroundTruth] message, information about moving and stationary _objects_ is provided from the _scenario_ engine to the sensor model. This entails _object_ positions, orientations, speeds and so on for every simulation time step, but also a so-called model reference. This reference is the path to a _3D asset_ associated with the _object_ or the stationary environment. Using the pose information together with the 3D mesh data, a _3D environment_ is constructed and updated for every simulation time step. Further attributes, such as https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/V3.6.0/gen/structosi3_1_1MovingObject_1_1VehicleAttributes_1_1WheelData.html[wheel positions] for vehicles or https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/V3.6.0/gen/structosi3_1_1MovingObject_1_1PedestrianAttributes_1_1Bone.html[bone poses] for pedestrians, enable a more refined movement of traffic participants in the _3D environment_.

.Use case 9: Simulating energy or _signal propagation_ with _3D assets_ linked to _material properties_
|===
|*Description*                      |As a _simulation platform_ or sensor model developer, I want to simulate the energy or _signal propagation_ using imported _3D assets_ with linked _material properties_. This is, for example, done with ray tracing. Rays are launched in a virtual 3D scene to simulate the propagation of light beams, radio waves, or ultrasonic waves. The interaction of the rays with the surfaces of the _objects_ in the _3D environment_ depends on the _material properties_ of these surfaces. These properties are assigned to the 3D geometries of the _objects_ and imported from a material database.
The simulation shall be able to cope with different real-time requirements, for example, SiL, HiL, open-loop, closed-loop.
