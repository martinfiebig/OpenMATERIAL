ASAM e.V. (Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems) is a non-profit organization that promotes standardization of tool chains in automotive development and testing.
Our members are international car manufacturers, suppliers, tool vendors, engineering service providers, and research institutes.
ASAM standards are developed by experts from our member companies and are based on real use cases.
ASAM is the legal owner of these standards and is responsible for their distribution and marketing.

ASAM standards span a wide range of use cases in automotive development, test, and validation.
They define file formats, data models, protocols, and interfaces.
The standards enable easy exchange of data and tools within and across tool chains.
They are applied worldwide.

{THIS_STANDARD} defines physical _material properties_ and standardizes _3D model_ structures addressing the need for accurate, standardized _3D assets_ and _material properties_ to simulate sensor behavior effectively.

{THIS_STANDARD} is divided into two key chapters:

- Material: Covers formats and definitions for _material properties_, such as surface roughness and electromagnetic properties.
- Geometry: Establishes structures for object classes, standardizing nodes, naming, and coordinate systems to support _3D model_ exchange and animation.
