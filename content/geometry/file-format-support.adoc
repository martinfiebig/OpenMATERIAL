ASAM OpenMATERIAL does not define its own 3D model format.
However, the geometry specification defines coordinate systems, units, node hierarchies, and more, which can be applied across different 3D model formats.

ASAM OpenMATERIAL supports the 3D model file formats glTF, FBX, and USD with the following considerations:

**glTF**

ASAM OpenMATERIAL 3D models in glTF format SHALL comply with the official https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html[glTF specification].

The glTF coordinate system is right-handed, with +Y as the up axis, +Z as forward, and -X as right. The front of a glTF asset faces +Z. 

This setup differs from how coordinate systems are defined in ASAM OpenMATERIAL, see xref:geometry/general.adoc#_coordinate_systems[Coordinate systems].
While modeling, the ASAM OpenMATERIAL coordinate definitions SHALL be used.
During export to and import from glTF, a coordinate transformation SHALL be applied to conform with the glTF specification.
Common modeling tools like Blender handle this conversion automatically.

**FBX**

Although FBX lacks a formal specification, ASAM OpenMATERIAL 3D models in FBX format SHALL be compatible with the official https://help.autodesk.com/view/FBX/2020/ENU/?guid=FBX_Developer_Help_welcome_to_the_fbx_sdk_html[AUTODESK FBX SDK].

**USD**

ASAM OpenMATERIAL 3D models in USD format SHALL comply with the official https://openusd.org/release/index.html[USD specification].

The USD coordinate specification allows either +Y or +Z as the up axis, defined in the upAxis metadata.
To adhere to the ASAM OpenMATERIAL geometry specification, +Z SHALL be used as the up axis.
