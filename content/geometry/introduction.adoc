= Introduction

== Motivation

A 3D asset is a digital entity that includes a 3D geometric representation of an object along with its attributes and metadata. 
Common formats for storing the geometry and visual materials of 3D models include glTF, FBX, and USD.

However, these formats do not provide a standardized way to structure the geometry or provide extensive metadata storage and exchange capabilities. 
The ASAM OpenMATERIAL standard addresses these needs.

The ASAM OpenMATERIAL asset file (for example, "omg_my-model.xoma") contains essential information relevant to the display and interactivity attributes of the 3D model in various computer applications.
This includes metadata, material mappings, and semantic information like coordinate system and pivot point descriptions.
The mapping of materials is stored in a separate material mapping file (.xomm), which is linked in the asset file.
This setup ensures that the 3D asset can be consistently integrated into complex simulations or real-time environments with detailed material and dynamic properties.


== Use cases

To accurately replicate how sensors interact with objects in the real world, it is essential to model the behavior of sensors like cameras, radars, and lidars based on the material and geometric properties of objects in a virtual environment. For this purpose, assets that conform to the ASAM OpenMATERIAL standards may be necessary in various scenarios, such as:

* Accurate simulation of sensor perception: 3D assets are essential to ensure that sensors interact realistically with their environment. This includes both the visual representation, such as how objects appear and are detected by the sensor, and the material properties, like how objects reflect or absorb signals such as light or radar waves.
* Dynamic and real-time environment simulation: 3D assets with changing materials or dynamic properties, such as moving parts like wheels, are necessary to simulate environments where the interaction between sensors and objects is constantly evolving.
* Semantic labeling for machine learning applications: Assets with semantic information about sub-meshes, or labels for parts of objects, enable the system to understand and differentiate between different parts of an object, such as the wheels or windows of a car, aiding in accurate training.
* Re-using 3D assets: Using the same asset file in different simulation tools is only possible if the structure of the assets is standardized.


== Role of 3D exchange formats

3D exchange formats like glTF, FBX, and USD are widely used across various industries for standardized 3D model representation.

In the context of ASAM OpenMATERIAL, these formats form the foundation for seamlessly integrating ASAM OpenMATERIAL into existing 3D modeling and simulation workflows. 
Users can continue using their familiar tools and processes to manage geometry, while ASAM OpenMATERIAL extends these formats by adding material properties, semantic information, and dynamic behaviors through additional files, such as asset files and material mapping files.

== Interaction with other ASAM standards

The ASAM OpenX standards strive to provide comprehensive, realistic, and most importantly, exchangeable simulation data for the development and testing of autonomous systems:

* ASAM OpenDRIVE standardizes the description of road networks, including some geometric definitions of the road surface, but primarily focuses on the semantic description of the road. The ASAM OpenMATERIAL object class "Environment" enhances this by allowing the definition of a comprehensive 3D environment that aligns with an ASAM OpenDRIVE map.
* ASAM OpenSCENARIO is a file format created to describe dynamic content in driving and traffic simulators, with a primary focus on complex maneuvers involving multiple entities like vehicles and pedestrians. ASAM OpenMATERIAL defines node structures and metadata for these object classes to seamlessly integrate ASAM OpenSCENARIO definitions with a 3D model.
The 3D environment SHALL be linked in ASAM OpenSCENARIO using the https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/RoadNetwork.html[SceneGraphFile property], while
Individual objects, such as vehicles, SHALL be linked using the https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/07_components_scenario/07_02_storyboard_entities.html#_3d_models_for_entities[model3d property].
* ASAM Open Simulation Interface (OSI) is a specification for interfaces between models and components in a distributed simulation. OSI primarily focuses on the environmental perception of automated driving functions, but it also covers interfaces for models of traffic participants.
