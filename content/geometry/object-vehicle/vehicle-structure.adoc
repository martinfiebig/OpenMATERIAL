== Grp_Exterior

This group contains all parts of the vehicle's exterior.

Typically, this group do not move in the simulation and therefore do not have their own transforms.

|===

== Grp_Exterior_Dynamic

This group contains all dynamic parts of the vehicle's exterior.

Dynamic parts are geometric structures whose position and orientation relative to the vehicle's origin may change throughout a simulation.
They may also change their state during the simulation, which is why lights are considered dynamic.

Typically, this group does not move in the simulation and therefore does not have its own transforms.

== Grp_Wheel_<axle_idx>_<wheel_idx>

This group contains all geometries of a single wheel assembly, which may consist of the tire, rim, brake caliper, and so on.

`<axle_idx>` denotes the index of the axle to which the wheel is mounted,
counting from front to rear, starting with 0.

`<wheel_idx>` denotes the index of the wheel on the specified axle, counting from right to left in positive y-direction, starting with 0.
For example, the wheel on the front left of a standard vehicle would be labeled `Grp_Wheel_0_1`.

Wheel steering is represented by rotation around the z-axis.
Wheel camber is defined by a rotation around the x-axis.
Suspension deflection is represented by translation along the z-axis.
Zero rotation and translation around all axles are defined under neutral load conditions.
In the 3D model, both caster and camber angles are ignored.

switched on or off, static elements never change state during the simulation.

This group typically does not move in the simulation and therefore does not have its own transforms.

== Grp_Interior

This group contains all parts of the vehicle's interior.
The interior is separated from the exterior to allow for disabling or exchanging it in the simulation.

This group typically does not move in the simulation and therefore does not have its own transforms.

== Grp_Interior_Dynamic

This group contains all dynamic parts of the vehicle's interior.
Dynamic elements are geometric structures whose position and orientation relative to the vehicle's origin may change throughout the simulation.

They may also change their state during the simulation. Examples of dynamic elements are lights, which can be switched on and off.
This group typically does not move in the simulation and therefore does not have its own transforms.

== Grp_Mirror_Rearview_Mounting_<rearview_mirror_mounting_idx>

This group contains all parts of a vehicle's rearview mirror mounting.

`<rearview_mirror_mounting_idx>` denotes the index of rearview mirror mountings. The index entries
are sorted from right to left in positive y-direction, and from front to rear, starting with 0.

The index is used consistently, regardless of whether the mirror is mounted to
the door or to the vehicle body.

== Grp_Mirror_Rearview_View_<rearview_mirror_view_idx>

This group is an empty node that represents the view direction of the mirror
glass on a rearview mirror.

It is a child node of the corresponding mirror joint group.

`<rearview_mirror_view_idx>` denotes the index of rearview mirrors. The index entries
are sorted from right to left in positive y-direction, and from front to rear, starting with 0.

== Grp_Seat_<seat_row>_<seat_idx> 

This group contains all parts of the vehicles's seats.

The seat position can be used to place a human 3D model as a passenger.
Therefore, a bench consists of multiple individual seats.

`<seat_row_idx>` denotes a row of seats, counted from the front to the rear, starting with 0.
`<seat_idx>` denotes the index of a seat per row. The index entries
are sorted from right to left in positive y-direction, starting with 0.

== Grp_Interior_Static

This group contains all static parts of the vehicle's interior.
Static elements are geometric structures that have a fixed position and orientation relative to the vehicle's origin throughout the simulation.

In contrast to lights, which change their state depending on whether they are
switched on or off, static elements never change state during the simulation.

This group typically does not move in the simulation and therefore does not have its own transforms.

== Grp_Vehicle_Part

One or more optional vehicle parts may be added to the main vehicle structure.

A vehicle part is a large component of a vehicle that moves in a slightly
different direction than other parts, for example, the vehicle part follows an
individual path during turns.

A vehicle may have multiple vehicle parts at the same hierarchy level or in a parent-child relationship.
This typically applies to articulated vehicles, such as a front loader with a hinged axis or an articulated bus with a hinge in the middle, and may also apply to construction vehicles.
When a vehicle part can be detached, like a trailer, it is treated as a separate object, not as a vehicle part.

The child nodes of a vehicle part may follow the same structure as the main vehicle. For example, if a vehicle part has lights, they may use the same structure and naming conventions as those on the main vehicle.

Standard passenger vehicles do not have separate parts.
