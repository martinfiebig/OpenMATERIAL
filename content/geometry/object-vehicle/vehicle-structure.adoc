== Grp_Vehicle_Part_<part_idx>_<keyword> 

A vehicle part is a large structure of the vehicle (part), that moves independently from other parts of the same vehicle.
This mainly applies to articulated vehicles, e.g. a front loader with a hinged axis or an articulated bus with a hinge in the middle.
When a vehicle part can be detached, like a trailer, it is to be treated as a separate object and not a vehicle part.

Standard vehicles only have one part and no keyword.
Therefore, only one Grp_Vehicle_Part exists with the name `Grp_Vehicle_Part_0`.

The `<part_idx>` must be added to all sub-nodes, as multiple nodes with the same name in different vehicle parts are not possible.
There cannot be a node `Grp_Exterior` in both `Grp_Vehicle_Part_0` and `Grp_Vehicle_Part_1`.

NOTE: Define the origin of the vehicle (part)

NOTE: Add description and examples for keywords

NOTE: Add a figure visualizing e.g. a hinged bus to explain what vehicle parts are.

== Grp_Exterior_<part_idx>

This group contains all elements of the exterior of the vehicle (part).

This group typically does not move in the simulation and therefore does not have its own transforms.

== Grp_Exterior_Dynamic_<part_idx>

This group contains all dynamic elements of the exterior of the vehicle (part).
Dynamic elements are geometry structures which position and orientation relative to the origin on the vehicle (part) might change throughout a simulation.
They may also change their state during the simulation, therefore lights are considered dynamic.

This group typically does not move in the simulation and therefore does not have its own transforms.

== Grp_Wheel_<part_idx>_<axle_idx>_<wheel_idx>

This group contains all geometries of one wheel assembly.
This may include tire, rim, brake caliper etc.

The `<axle_idx>` denotes the index of the axle the wheel is mounted to, counting from the front to the rear, starting with 0.
The `<wheel_idx>` denotes the index of the wheel on the specified axle, counting from right to left (in positive y direction), starting with 0.
Example: The wheel on the front left of a standard vehicle would be `Grp_Wheel_0_1`.

Steering of the wheel is implemented by a rotation around the z-axis.
Wheel camber is defined by a rotation around the x-axis.
Suspension deflection is represented by a translation along the z-axis.
Zero rotation and and translation around all axles are defined in neutral load conditions.
In the 3D model, both caster and camber angles are neglected.
